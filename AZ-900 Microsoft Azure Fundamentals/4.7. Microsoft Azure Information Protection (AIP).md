# Microsoft Purview Information Protection (MPIP)

- üìù Helps to classify and optionally protect (encrypt) documents and emails by applying labels.
- Labels can be applied
  - automatically based on rules and conditions
  - or manually
- E.g. when a user saves a Microsoft Word document containing a credit card number, a custom tooltip is displayed. The tooltip recommends labeling the file as `Confidential \ All Employees` configured by the administrator.
- After your content is classified, you can track and control how the content is used. E.g. you can:
  - Analyze data flows to gain insight into your business
  - Detect risky behaviors and take corrective measures
  - Track access to documents
  - Prevent data leakage or misuse of confidential information
